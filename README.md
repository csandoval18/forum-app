# forum-app
Forum application that allows users to create posts about topics.

This app is built using MikroORM, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, TypegraphQL, Redis, Express, Apollo Server, and other npm packages used in mail features and session storage in the backend.
The front end of the app is built using NextJS to allow server side rendering of certain pages or componenets and easy routing capabilities. Formik is used for form handling, and Chakra UI is used 
for the styling of the applicaiton. URQL is used for a GraphQL client that allows the front end to fetch data from the server. Graphql codegen is used to easily create hooks and types of the GraphQL queries and mutations.
